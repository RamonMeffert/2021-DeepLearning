# Deep Learning -- Project 1

*Andreas Gassilloud & Ramon Meffert*

This project uses Python 3.7.4 and TensorFlow 2.3.1, since those are the most recent versions available in Peregrine. To facilitate multiple training configurations, both scripts accept some command line arguments. To see an explanation of these arguments, use `python <Script> -h`.

## AlexNet

The code for AlexNet was adapted from <https://analyticsindiamag.com/hands-on-guide-to-implementing-alexnet-with-keras-for-multi-class-image-classification/>.

## ResNet

The code for ResNet was adapted from <https://www.nablasquared.com/building-a-resnet-in-keras/>.
